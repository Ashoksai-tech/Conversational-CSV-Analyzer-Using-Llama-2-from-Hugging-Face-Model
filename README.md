 # Conversational CSV Analyzer Using Llama 2

## Overview

The **Conversational CSV Analyzer** is a Streamlit web application that allows users to interact with CSV files through natural language queries. By leveraging the Llama 2 model, the application enables users to gain insights from their data by asking questions about the contents of the uploaded CSV files. The app is built using Python and integrates various libraries, including Langchain, Hugging Face Transformers, and Streamlit Chat.

## Features

- Upload CSV files and visualize their contents.
- Ask questions about the data using natural language.
- Get conversational responses based on the uploaded CSV data.
- Store embeddings in a local FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the application.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **Langchain**: To handle document loading, embeddings, and conversational retrieval.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For leveraging pre-trained models for natural language processing.
- **FAISS**: For efficient vector storage and retrieval.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashoksai-tech/Conversational-CSV-Analyzer-Using-Llama-2-from-Hugging-Face-Model.git
   cd Conversational-CSV-Analyzer-Using-Llama-2-from-Hugging-Face-Model
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install required packages**:
   Make sure you have `pip` installed and then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit langchain langchain-community transformers faiss-cpu
   ```

4. **Download the required models**:
   The application uses the T5 model for text generation. Ensure that the model is downloaded when the application runs for the first time.

## Usage

1. **Run the application**:
   After installing the dependencies, you can start the Streamlit application with the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Upload a CSV file**:
   - Use the sidebar to upload your CSV file.
   - The application will display the contents of the CSV file in JSON format.

3. **Interact with the data**:
   - Type your query in the text input box and press **Interact**.
   - The application will provide responses based on the data in the CSV file.

## Example Queries

- "What is the average value in the `Sales` column?"
- "List all unique entries in the `Customer` column."
- "Show me the top 5 entries based on `Profit`."
